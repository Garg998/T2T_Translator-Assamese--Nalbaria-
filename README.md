# T2T_Translator-Assamese--Nalbaria-

The Assamese language, primarily spoken in the state of Assam, exhibits variations in vocabulary, intonation, and pronunciation across different regions. Dialectical differences are prominent, with various Assamese dialects prevailing in different areas. For instance, the Central Assam region, including Nagaon and nearby areas, has a distinct dialect compared to Eastern Assam. The Kamrupi dialect is widespread in regions such as Kamrup, Nalbari, Barpeta, Goalpara, Bongaigaon, with variations like Nalbaria, Barpetia, Goalparia spoken in respective districts. Communication challenges arise as people may struggle to understand each other's dialects, particularly in remote villages where some may not be familiar with standard Assamese.

To address this communication gap, there is a need for a system that facilitates effective information exchange among the indigenous people, regardless of their dialects. With technological advancements, various translators and speech synthesis systems have emerged worldwide. In Assam, a system is required to convert speech between standard Assamese and different dialects. The focus of this project is to design and implement a text-to-speech (TTS) system specifically for the Nalbaria variety of Assamese. Due to resource constraints, **the initial step involves creating a text-to-text (T2T) translator module for translating text from the standard variety to Nalbaria.** This system aims to benefit the indigenous people, particularly the Nalbaria society, promoting effective communication and understanding among diverse dialects within Assam.
